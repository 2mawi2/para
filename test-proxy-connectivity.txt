Test the network proxy connectivity for para's sandboxing feature.

IMPORTANT: This is a test to verify that the network proxy is working correctly with the sandbox.

Please perform the following tests:

1. First, check your environment:
   - Run `pwd` to confirm your working directory
   - Run `echo $HTTP_PROXY` and `echo $HTTPS_PROXY` to verify proxy settings
   - Check if you're in a sandboxed environment

2. Test basic network connectivity:
   - Try to make a simple curl request: `curl -I https://api.anthropic.com`
   - Try to access GitHub: `curl -I https://github.com`
   - Try to access a blocked domain: `curl -I https://example.com` (should fail)

3. Test Claude Code's connectivity:
   - Try a web search using the WebSearch tool for "test query"
   - Try fetching a webpage using WebFetch tool from https://github.com

4. Create a simple Python script to test network access:
   ```python
   import urllib.request
   import os
   
   print(f"HTTP_PROXY: {os.environ.get('HTTP_PROXY', 'Not set')}")
   print(f"HTTPS_PROXY: {os.environ.get('HTTPS_PROXY', 'Not set')}")
   
   try:
       response = urllib.request.urlopen('https://api.anthropic.com')
       print(f"Anthropic API: {response.status}")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Anthropic API Error: {e}")
   
   try:
       response = urllib.request.urlopen('https://example.com')
       print(f"Example.com: {response.status}")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Example.com Error: {e}")
   ```

5. Report your findings:
   - Which connections succeeded?
   - Which connections failed?
   - Are the proxy environment variables set correctly?
   - Can Claude Code access its required endpoints?

After completing all tests, use `para finish "Test proxy connectivity verification"` to save your results.
