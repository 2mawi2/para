# Git Constellation - A Celestial Journey Through Para's Evolution

## Overview

This visualization transforms the Para project's git history into an interactive celestial map where:
- **Commits are stars** ✨ - Each commit becomes a star in the night sky
- **Days are constellations** 🌌 - Commits from the same day form constellations
- **Time flows in spirals** 🌀 - Recent commits are in the center, older ones spiral outward
- **Star types reflect commit types** ⭐ - Different colors and sizes based on commit purpose

## How to View

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Move your mouse over stars to see commit details
3. Click on stars to create pulse effects
4. Watch for shooting stars that randomly appear!

## Star Classification

- **🌟 Golden Stars** - Release and version bumps (the brightest in our sky)
- **🔴 Red Giants** - Feature additions and implementations
- **🔵 Blue Stars** - Bug fixes and patches  
- **🟢 Green Stars** - Merge commits connecting branches
- **⚪ White Dwarfs** - Other commits (refactoring, docs, etc.)

## Project Statistics

The visualization shows key metrics:
- Total number of commits (stars in our universe)
- Number of active development days (constellations)
- Number of contributors (star gazers)
- Most productive day (brightest constellation)

## Technical Details

Built with:
- **D3.js** for data visualization and SVG manipulation
- **CSS animations** for twinkling stars and shooting star effects
- **Dynamic layouts** using spiral patterns for time representation
- **Interactive tooltips** showing commit details on hover

## The Story It Tells

Para's development journey unfolds like a cosmic dance:
- The intense burst of initial development (May 31 - June 1) created the first major star cluster
- Regular release cycles shine as golden stars throughout the constellation
- The recent MCP integration work forms a bright new constellation
- Each developer's contributions add their unique stellar signature

This visualization celebrates not just the code, but the collaborative effort that brought Para to life - each commit a star in the project's expanding universe.

## Fun Features

- **Shooting stars** randomly streak across the sky
- **Star twinkle animations** make the sky feel alive
- **Constellation connections** show related commits
- **Responsive design** adapts to your screen size
- **Click effects** create ripples in space-time
