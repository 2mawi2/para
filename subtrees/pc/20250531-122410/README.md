# Pursor - Parallel-Cursor Workflow Helper

A simple script to create multiple ephemeral Cursor IDE sessions on temporary Git worktrees, then merge or discard changes with a single command.

Perfect for prototyping multiple features simultaneously while keeping your main branch clean.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new parallel session
pursor

# Work in the new Cursor window that opens...

# Merge your changes back
pursor merge "Add new feature"
```

## üì¶ Installation

1. Copy `pursor.sh` to your Git repository
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x pursor.sh`
3. That's it! No external dependencies needed.

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
pursor                    # Create new session ‚Üí opens Cursor
pursor list               # List all active sessions (alias: ls)
pursor merge "message"    # Merge session back to main
pursor cancel             # Cancel/delete session (alias: abort)
pursor clean              # Cancel ALL sessions (clean everything)
```

### Multi-Session Workflow

```bash
# Create multiple sessions
pursor                    # Session 1 (opens Cursor)
pursor                    # Session 2 (opens Cursor) 

# List active sessions
pursor list
# Session: pc-20250531-143022
#   Branch: pc/20250531-143022
#   Status: Clean
# Session: pc-20250531-143025  
#   Branch: pc/20250531-143025
#   Status: Has uncommitted changes

# Merge sessions (auto-detects from current directory!)
cd subtrees/pc/20250531-143022
pursor merge "Feature A complete"

cd ../20250531-143025
pursor merge "Feature B complete"

# Or cancel individual sessions
pursor cancel

# Or cancel ALL sessions at once
pursor clean
# ‚úÖ cleaned up 3 session(s)
```

### Quick Reset

When you want to start fresh and clean up all parallel sessions:

```bash
pursor clean              # Cleans up everything
pursor list               # Verify: "No active parallel sessions."
```

## üîß Handling Conflicts

When merging sessions that modify the same files, you might get conflicts:

```bash
# Try to merge
pursor merge "Add feature"
# ‚ùå rebase conflicts in session pc-20250531-143022
#    ‚Üí resolve conflicts in /path/to/worktree
#    ‚Üí then run: pursor continue

# Fix conflicts manually in the worktree directory
cd subtrees/pc/20250531-143022
# Edit conflicted files to resolve conflicts
# (NO need to run git add!)

# Continue the merge with auto-staging
pursor continue
# ‚úÖ merge complete!
```

## üìÇ How It Works

- **Session Creation**: Creates `pc/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` branch and `subtrees/pc/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` worktree
- **State Tracking**: Uses `.pursor_state/` directory to track active sessions
- **Auto-Staging**: Automatically stages all changes during merge and conflict resolution
- **Context-Aware**: Auto-detects which session you're working on from your current directory
- **Clean Merging**: Attempts fast-forward, falls back to merge commit if needed
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Removes worktrees, branches, and state files after successful merge

## üí° Tips

- **Context Detection**: When working in a session directory, commands auto-detect the session
- **No Manual Git**: Never need to run `git add` - everything is auto-staged
- **Conflict Prevention**: Keep sessions focused on different areas of the codebase
- **Session Naming**: Session IDs are auto-generated timestamps for uniqueness
- **Cursor Integration**: Sessions automatically open in new Cursor windows
- **Run Anywhere**: Script works from any directory in the repository, including from within subtrees

## üåê Global Usage

The script automatically detects the repository root and current session context:

```bash
# From main repository directory
pursor merge "Feature complete"

# From within a subtree/worktree (auto-detects session!)
cd subtrees/pc/20250531-143022
pursor merge "Feature complete"    # Knows you mean this session
pursor continue                    # Resumes this session after conflicts
pursor cancel                      # Cancels this session

# From any subdirectory
cd src/components
pursor list                        # Shows all sessions
```

This makes it perfect for seamless workflow entirely within subtrees.

## üõ† Configuration

Set environment variables to customize behavior:

```bash
export BASE_BRANCH="develop"           # Base branch (default: current branch)
export SUBTREES_DIR_NAME="worktrees"  # Directory name (default: subtrees)
export STATE_DIR_NAME=".my_state"     # State directory (default: .pursor_state)
export CURSOR_CMD="code"               # Editor command (default: cursor)
```

## üéØ Perfect For

- ‚úÖ Prototyping multiple approaches
- ‚úÖ Working on independent features simultaneously  
- ‚úÖ Testing different implementations
- ‚úÖ Keeping experimental work isolated
- ‚úÖ Quick feature comparisons
- ‚úÖ Seamless conflict resolution workflow

## üî• Advanced Workflow

```bash
# Start multiple parallel experiments
pursor                              # Feature A
pursor                              # Feature B  
pursor                              # Feature C

# Work on Feature A
cd subtrees/pc/20250531-120001
# ... make changes ...
pursor merge "Implement approach A"  # Auto-stages & merges

# Work on Feature B (with conflicts)
cd ../20250531-120002
# ... make changes ...
pursor merge "Implement approach B"  # Conflict occurs!
# ... fix conflicts in editor ...
pursor continue                     # Auto-stages resolved files & completes

# Cancel Feature C (not working out)
cd ../20250531-120003
pursor cancel                       # Clean removal

# All done - verify clean state
cd ../../..
pursor list                         # "No active parallel sessions."
```
