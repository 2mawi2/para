Test the permissive sandbox profile to ensure it works correctly on macOS:

1. Verify that Claude CLI launched successfully in sandbox mode
2. Test file operations:
   - Try to read files from the project directory (should work)
   - Try to write a test file to the project directory (should work)
   - Try to write a test file to /tmp (should work)
   - Try to write to ~/.ssh/test.txt (should fail)
   - Try to read from ~/.ssh/known_hosts (should work - read is allowed)
3. Test network access by making a simple web request (should work)
4. Report all results with exact error messages when operations are blocked
5. Use `para finish "Test permissive sandbox profile"` when done

For each operation, clearly report:
- What you tried to do
- Whether it succeeded or failed
- The exact error message if it failed
- Whether this matches the expected behavior
