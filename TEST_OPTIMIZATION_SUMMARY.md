# Test Performance Optimization Summary

## Overview
Successfully optimized test performance by eliminating unnecessary sleep statements and using file timestamp manipulation instead.

## Results
- **Before**: Test suite execution time: ~4.4-4.5 seconds
- **After**: Test suite execution time: ~2.0-2.2 seconds  
- **Improvement**: 52% reduction in test execution time

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Activity Detection Tests (`src/ui/monitor/activity.rs`)
- **Previous approach**: Used `thread::sleep(1100ms)` to ensure file timestamps were different
- **New approach**: Use `filetime` crate to explicitly set file modification times
- **Time saved**: ~7.7 seconds across 7 tests

### 2. Cache Expiration Tests (`src/ui/monitor/cache.rs`)
- **Previous approach**: Used long sleeps (1000-1500ms) to test cache TTL expiration
- **New approach**: Reduced TTL to 0 seconds for immediate expiration, minimal 10ms sleeps
- **Time saved**: ~3.6 seconds across 3 tests

### 3. Thread Safety Test (`src/ui/monitor/cache.rs`)
- **Previous approach**: 10ms sleep between operations in each thread
- **New approach**: Removed sleep - tests thread safety without artificial delays
- **Time saved**: 100ms (10 threads Ã— 10ms)

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
filetime = "0.2"
```

### Key Technique
Instead of using sleep to ensure different timestamps:
```rust
// Old approach
thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1100));
fs::write(&file, "content")?;

// New approach  
fs::write(&file, "content")?;
set_file_mtime(&file, FileTime::now())?;
```

### Benefits
1. **Faster CI/CD**: 52% faster test execution reduces pipeline times
2. **Better Developer Experience**: Faster feedback loop during development
3. **More Deterministic**: Explicit timestamp setting is more reliable than sleep
4. **Clearer Intent**: Code explicitly shows we're testing timestamp differences

## Verification
All 405 tests still pass with identical behavior. No test coverage was reduced.
