# 3D Git History Visualization

Create a stunning 3D Three.js visualization that transforms git commit history into an immersive, explorable world.

## Requirements

1. **Create directory structure**: `git-history-3d/` in the project root
2. **Technology**: Use Three.js for 3D rendering, modern JavaScript/TypeScript
3. **Git Integration**: Parse git history using git commands or a library
4. **Visual Design**: Create a surprising and beautiful 3D representation where:
   - Each commit is represented as a unique 3D object (could be crystals, planets, buildings, trees, etc.)
   - Branches form paths or connections in 3D space
   - Time flows through one axis (could be vertical, spiral, or along a path)
   - Commit metadata (author, message, files changed) influences visual properties
   - Interactive: Users can navigate, zoom, click on commits for details
   
5. **Features to implement**:
   - Camera controls for free navigation
   - Click/hover interactions showing commit details
   - Visual encoding of commit properties (size = files changed, color = author, etc.)
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Ambient effects (particles, lighting, fog) for atmosphere
   - Option to filter by author, date range, or branch

6. **Make it surprising**: Think creatively! Some ideas:
   - Galaxy theme where commits are stars/planets
   - Underground cave system with glowing crystals
   - Futuristic city where commits are buildings
   - Organic growth like a tree or coral reef
   - Abstract art installation with flowing connections

7. **Performance**: Handle repositories with thousands of commits efficiently

8. **User Experience**: 
   - Simple to run (npm install && npm start)
   - Works in modern browsers
   - Responsive and smooth even with large histories

When done: para integrate "Add 3D git history visualization with Three.js"
