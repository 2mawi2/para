# Evaluate Custom Electron Wrapper Approach

## Task
Analyze the feasibility of creating a dedicated Electron application that embeds multiple VS Code instances for Para's multi-instance Claude Code support.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Technical Feasibility
- Embedding VS Code/code-server in Electron
- WebView vs iframe considerations
- IPC communication between instances
- Memory and performance impact

### 2. Development Effort
- Electron app setup and maintenance
- Distribution and installation
- Auto-update mechanism
- Code signing requirements

### 3. Integration with Para
- Launching from Rust CLI
- Session state synchronization
- File system access and permissions
- Git worktree integration

### 4. User Experience
- Custom UI/UX possibilities
- Performance vs native VS Code
- Extension compatibility
- Settings synchronization

### 5. Maintenance Considerations
- Electron version updates
- VS Code API changes
- Security patches
- Cross-platform building

### 6. Pros and Cons
- Full control over experience
- Distribution complexity
- Resource overhead
- Development time investment

## Deliverables
1. Architecture diagram
2. MVP feature list
3. Development timeline estimate
4. Recommendation score (1-10)

Please create a detailed evaluation in a file called `evaluation_electron_wrapper.md`

## Prototype Implementation
Create a working prototype in the `prototypes/electron-wrapper/` directory that demonstrates:
1. Basic Electron app structure
2. Multiple webview tabs for VS Code instances
3. Tab switching functionality
4. Launch script from Para

Build a minimal working version. DO NOT run `para finish` - leave the implementation for review.
