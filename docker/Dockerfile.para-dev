# Para Development Docker Image
# This image is built on top of para-claude:latest to ensure auth compatibility.

# Need to use sudo since para-claude runs as non-root user
RUN sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
    # Python development
    python3-pip \
    # Network tools
    jq \
    # Text processing
    ripgrep \
    && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
