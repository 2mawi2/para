echo "   - Daemon manages watchers in a HashMap keyed by session name"
echo "   - Each watcher stores its associated repo_root"  
echo "   - Config is loaded per-repository from repo_root/.para/config.json"
echo "   - Signal files are processed in session-specific worktree paths"

echo -e "\n4. Architecture ensures isolation because:"
echo "   - Each repository has its own .para/worktrees/ directory"
echo "   - Watchers monitor only their assigned worktree path"
echo "   - No cross-repository file access is possible"
echo "   - Session names must be unique (enforced by SessionManager)"

echo -e "\n=== Isolation Test Analysis Complete ==="
echo "The daemon implementation correctly isolates repositories through:"
echo "1. Path-based separation (.para/worktrees per repo)"
echo "2. Session name uniqueness per repository" 
echo "3. Repository-specific config loading"
echo "4. Isolated SignalFileWatcher instances per session"
